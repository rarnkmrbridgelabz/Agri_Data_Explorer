# Agri_Data_Explorer

India's agricultural sector is vital for the economy, but the management of agricultural data remains a challenge due to its complexity, fragmented nature, and lack of easy access. Various stakeholders such as farmers, policymakers, and researchers face difficulties in accessing, analyzing, and making informed decisions based on agricultural data.
The goal of this project is to create a data visualization platform that integrates agricultural data from different states and districts in India. The platform will provide insights into crop production, yields, and areas under cultivation, making it easier for users to identify trends, gaps, and regional disparities. This solution aims to help farmers optimize crop choices, assist policymakers in targeting areas for intervention, and support researchers in analyzing agricultural trends.
